Zombies
=======

Some hopeful design, and some UI functionality for command input.

This wordpress blog was about this project and another project or two of mine.

The zombies project is based in simple C++ (Now C++11 :D) and is designed to be compiled with MinGW.

This was a learning project, and never got close to my actual intentions. It does include some early look-ins at dynamic objects that could be customized at run time, to make modifiable environments, but it was probably at this point that I felt that the code I was making was better suited elsewhere. 

I'm fairly certain that the code here will turn into a text based interface for my "Civil" project. (formerly RPGengine)\
