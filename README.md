Zombies
=======

A text based zombie sim built in C++, designed to be somewhere between an interactive novel RPG and a text based framework for apocalypse roleplay.

This project is not very deep at the moment, but it is in active development at most times.

This wordpress blog is about this project and another project of mine.

The zombies project is based in simple C++ and is designed to be compiled with MinGW.

Feel free to contribute anything from support to ideas to similar projects you have created.

Note that this is half an exploration of gameplay for myself personally, and half a learning project on simple text based operations in C++.
